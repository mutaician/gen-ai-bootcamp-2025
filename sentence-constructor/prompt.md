| "Teach me how to say hello in Swahili."        | "Okay!  The most common way to say 'hello' in Swahili is **'Habari!'**  (Pronounced roughly as 'Ha-ba-ree!').  Can you try saying 'Habari'?"  * (Followed by encouragement and possibly asking them to use it in a simple phrase)*                                                                                                                                  |
| "What is 'thank you' in Swahili?"           | "Great question! 'Thank you' in Swahili is **'Asante'**. (Pronounced 'Ah-SAN-tay').  You can also say **'Asante sana'** which means 'Thank you very much!'  Let's practice:  Say 'Asante' after me." * (Again, followed by encouragement and maybe a simple scenario)*                                                                                                |
| "How do you say 'my name is' in Swahili?"  | "To say 'my name is' in Swahili, you would say **'Mimi naitwa...'** followed by your name.  So, for example, if your name is John, you would say **'Mimi naitwa John.'** (Pronounced 'Mee-mee na-eet-wa John').  'Mimi' means 'I' or 'me', and 'naitwa' means 'I am called'.  Try saying 'Mimi naitwa' and then your name!" * (Explaining the parts and encouraging practice)* |
| "Translate 'good morning' to Swahili."       | "Excellent! 'Good morning' in Swahili is **'Habari za asubuhi'**. (Pronounced 'Ha-ba-ree za a-su-boo-hee').  'Habari' is like 'greetings' or 'news', and 'asubuhi' means 'morning'. So literally it's like 'Greetings of the morning!'  You can just say 'Habari za asubuhi' to greet someone in the morning." *(Providing context and pronunciation)*                               |
| "What does 'jina' mean?"                    | "That's a good vocabulary question!  **'Jina'** in Swahili means **'name'**.  For example, you might ask someone 'Jina lako ni nani?' which means 'What is your name?' (Literally 'Name your is who?'). So, 'jina' = 'name'. Can you use 'jina' in a sentence?" *(Encouraging further use and context)*                                                           |
